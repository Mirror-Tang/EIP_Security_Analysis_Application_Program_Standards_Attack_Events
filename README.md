# EIP_Security_Analysis_Application_Program_Standards_Attack_Events
We conducted research on the current state of EIP security, performed case studies, and provided security recommendations. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security features and potential risks of these proposals, and to propose practical solutions to enhance the security of EIPs.

## What else are we doing?
What else are we doing?We also probably continue my research on the risks of migrating smart contracts between EVM-based Layer 2 networks. In fact, due to the different characteristics of various L2 solutions, there are significant risks involved in migrating smart contracts across different public chains. You can refer to my paper titled "Smart Contract Migration: Security Analysis and Recommendations from Ethereum to Arbitrum" for more information on the migration risks related to Arbitrum.

We excel at problem identification, whether it is in the field of smart contract security audits or academia. Our expertise in smart contract knowledge and academic writing enables us to produce effective and easily understandable content. We are also passionate about problem-solving and spreading blockchain knowledge across various industries. For example:

Simple features and minor vulnerabilities often lead to major troubles. However, many of these troubles are caused by disclosed vulnerabilities or features. There is still a long way to go in terms of developer education, and I believe I have been on that path...


## About Me
I am an interdisciplinary blockchain scientist involved in researching blockchain engineering and social sciences. My areas of focus include smart contract security, performance of distributed systems, and analysis of data and economics in the fee market. I am intrigued by comprehending the intricate interplay between social and technological aspects in collective decision-making within the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, I strive to strike a harmonious balance between the performance, security, and technological freedom of  blockchains.
Cybersecurity and data-driven decision-making have numerous applications in the realm of blockchain. They can aid in preventing data validation errors, service interruptions or rollbacks, as well as fund theft. Moreover, they can enhance the sustainability of the economic model, thereby addressing significant challenges.
